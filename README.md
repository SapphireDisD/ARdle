# ARdle - Custom Wordle

ARdle is a custom and open source wordle game. It was originally meant for Argentinian cities (that's why the name!) but then it got modified for any value!
To edit the values, you just have to replace values.json in src/
The game is similar to Wordle but you have a new word every refresh!
It's compiled like a normal React app.
